Prerequisites: Python Syntax , Programming Basics


Level: Mixed (intermediate to advance)

I started learning programming in unuversity with C , then Java and C++.
But when I tried Python , I fell in love with its simple, clear, readable syntax.
So I decided to review some problems to broaden my knowledge in this valuable language.
If you have already studied programming (in other languages) just study basic syntax
of Python and join me in this journey. 

I will push problems and their solutions time to time after practicing them.

If you had any suggestion or question , feel free to contact me through Email.
